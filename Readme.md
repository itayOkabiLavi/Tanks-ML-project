## How to run the project
After cloning\download run the command `python run.py x`, where x is one of the following:

1. htz - you can play the game with arrows and space bar
2. atz - automatic actions from the ML algorithm (pretty stupid so far). Notice that 
infinite loop will probably appear, so exit the program by `ctrl`+`c`.

Note: currently, `run.py` runs a simple version of the game, where we will develop and test the basic
learning methods.
